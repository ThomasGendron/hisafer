\title{Builds a Hi-sAFe experiment}
\usage{
build_hisafe_exp(hip, path, exp.name = "experiment", profiles = "all",
  saveProjectOption = FALSE, controls = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{hip}{An object of class "hip" - typically with multiple simulations (rows).}

\item{path}{A character string of the path to the folder in which the experiment folder should be created.}

\item{profiles}{A character vector of output profiles the simulation to export.}

\item{saveProjectOption}{Logical, sets the saveProjectOption parameter in the .sim file.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list containing the original hip object and path to the experiment folder.
}
\description{
Builds a Hi-sAFe experiment (a group of simulations) - creates the folder structure and input files.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Once a group Hi-sAFe simulations (experiment) is defined:
myexp <- define_hisafe(latitude = c(30,60))

# Building the experiment folder structure & files:
build_hisafe_exp(myexp, "./simulations", exp.name = "lat_exp")

\title{Read output from a Hi-sAFe experiment}
\usage{
read_hisafe_exp(hip = NULL, path = NULL, profiles = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{hip}{An object of class "hip". To create a hip object see \code{\link{define_exp}}.
If the hip object contains a \code{path} value, then this can be used without providing \code{path} directly to \code{read_hisafe_exp}.
If \code{hip} is not provided, then \code{path} is required and the input data for the experiment is read from the experiment
summary .csv file created when building the experiment.}

\item{path}{A character string of the path to the directory containing the Hi-sAFe simulation folders
(which each contain the standard subdirectories with the outputs).
If \code{hip} is not provided, then \code{path} is required. If both \code{hip} and \code{path} are provided, \code{path} is used.}

\item{profiles}{A character vector of the names of Hi-sAFe output profiles to read. Defaults to reading all supported Hi-sAFe output profiles via "all".
Currently supported profiles are: annualplot, annualtree, annualcrop, plot, trees, roots, cells, voxels, climate, monthCells.}
}
\value{
An object of class "hop-group". This is a list of 15 data frames (tibbles):
\code{annualtree},
\code{annualcrop},
\code{annualplot},
\code{trees},
\code{plot},
\code{climate},
\code{roots},
\code{monthCells},
\code{cells},
\code{voxels},
\code{variables} (variable descriptions and units from all profiles),
\code{inputs} (the hip object that generated the simulation),
\code{path} (the path to the simulation folder),
\code{exp.plan} (the manipulated input variables in the experiment), and
\code{exp.path} (the path to the experiment folder).
}
\description{
Reads the designated output profiles from a Hi-sAFe experiiment (i.e. a group of Hi-sAFe simulations).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# After reading in Hi-sAFe simulation data via:
myexp <- read_hisafe_exp(MyExpPlan, "./")

# If only the annual tree data is required:
mytreeexp <- read_hisafe(MyExpPlan, "./", profiles = "annualtree")
}
}
